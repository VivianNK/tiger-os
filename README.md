# Tiger SOS

### Inspiration
Goal: Giving student who may feel unsafe a discreet way of contacting public safety(respective to their campus). From the data collected, campus police can see what areas to patrol at certain times to best utilize RIT's resources.

### What it does
While walking home, hold a button on your phone. The screen goes dark so as to be discrete. Upon release, you are asked whether you are safe. If you select no or haven't selected anything in 10 seconds, the app texts RIT Public Safety your location and that you need help.

### What's next for TigerSOS
In the future we want to finish implementing the database and add data analytics.
